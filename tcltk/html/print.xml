   Under Wylib, there are two distinct printing modes: Postscript and Text.
   Postscript is a markup language used for rendering images, figures and various text fonts.
   Wylib typically uses lout or some other processor to create postscript pages.
   The pages are then previewed in ghostview or some other application and so they can be printed according to the instructions for that particular application.

   But this help applies only to Text Printing.
  </para><para>
   Wylib text windows and listboxes contain text which typically can not be formatted in different fonts nor can it include figures.
   It is just straight text, with fixed line and column spacing.

   Such text can be sent to a standard system printer without much in the way of fancy formatting.
   It can also be sent via email, saved to a file, or transmitted via FAX.
