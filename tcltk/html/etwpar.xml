   The paragraph Embedded Text Widget (ETW) allows you to produce a number
   of paragraphs within your document that are formatted like an outline.
  </para><para>
   For example, sometimes it is desirable to create a set of numbered
   paragraphs. 
   Although this widget does not do automatic numbering, it does take care
   of indenting the paragraphs correctly.
  </para><para>
   Like all ETW's, there is a main menu in the upper left part of the widget
   where all the widget's functionality can be accessed.
