If you don't want this installed under /usr/lib, first set the variable:

    WYLIB=/some/dir

Then do

    make install

This should install the library either in /usr/lib or /some/dir.  You should now be able
to run any wylib application that has this in it:

    package require wylib


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that Tcl-only programs can still use some limited capabilities of wylib.  But most of
Wylib's functionality is intended for use with Tcl/Tk (GUI).  

There are some of the library modules that presume the use of a PostgreSQL backend (like
dbe, dbp and sql for example).
