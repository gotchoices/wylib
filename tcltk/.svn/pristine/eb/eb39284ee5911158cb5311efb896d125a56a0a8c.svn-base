   The address Embedded Text Widget (ETW) contains the data necessary to
   create the address and opening greeting (Dear John:) at the top of your 
   letter.
  </p><p>
   Like all ETW's, there is a main menu in the upper left part of the widget
   where all the widget's functionality can be accessed.
   Just under the menu button are two shortcut buttons (Get and Label)
   to allow faster access to two common functions also found in the menu.
  </p><p>
   It is possible to include multiple address widgets in your letter as
   long as only one of them is listed as a primary recipient (To:).
   Other widgets can be copy (CC:) recipients and they will be listed
   appropriately at the bottom of your letter.
  </p><p>
   When the letter editor is launched from a contact manager, the first
   address widget should already be filled out for with the correct data
   for the person you are writing to.
   But when the letter editor is used as a stand-alone application, you
   will have to fill out all fields manually.
  </p></div><div class="sect1" title="Standard Fields"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2990713"></a>Standard Fields</h2></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Recip:</span></dt><dd>
       Specify whether this recipient is the primary recipient (the main
       person you are writing to) or someone who is to receive a copy of 
       the letter.  
       A normal copy recipient will be listed at the bottom of the letter.
       A blind (or hidden) copy recipient will not be shown on the letter.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">(Name):</span></dt><dd>
       This entry (just to the right of Recip) has no title shown (except ":").
       It should contain the full name of the person you are writing the
       letter to.
       This name will show up at the top of additional pages of a multiple
       page letter.
       It will also become the first line of any address labels you generate.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">ID:</span></dt><dd>
       This field is not editable.
       It gets filled in automatically by the program and is the ID number
       of the contact you are writing to if the letter was launched from a
       contact manager.
       Typically, when the letter is sent, a copy will be logged to the
       database by the contact manager program.
       This ID number is used to tell the program where to log the letter
       so if no number is shown in this field, no logging will be done.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">(Address)</span></dt><dd>
       This (untitled) multi-line entry area contains the mailing address
       of the person you are writing to.
       This area should not include the name of the person--only the address.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Salu:</span></dt><dd>
       This field specifies the salutation (Dear Bob:) or greeting that will
       be used as an opening for the letter.
       The pull-down button should enable a dialog of several optional
       greetings based on the data you entered in the name field.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Email:</span></dt><dd>
       Enter the email address of the person this letter is going to.
       This will facilitate distributing the letter electronically.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">FAX:</span></dt><dd>
       Enter the FAX number of the person this letter is going to.
       This will facilitate distributing the letter via facsimile.
      </dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Menu Options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2989512"></a>Menu Options</h2></div></div></div>
   The widget menu contains a number of functions to allow you to control
   the address information.
   The menu functions are as follows:

   <div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Get Contact Info</span></dt><dd>
       If the letter editor was launched from a contact manager, this
       option should load all the fields automatically with data from the
       "current contact" loaded in the contact manager.
       
       This avoids the need of filling out the address fields manually.
       Just select the contact you want to reference in the contact manager
       and press the Get button to fill out all the fields.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Print Label</span></dt><dd>
       This will generate an address label in the print dialog.
       The first time you use this, select the correct label printer and
       size the window down so it is a convenient size.
       From then on, it should retain those default settings.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Select Salutaion</span></dt><dd>
       This allows you to select one of several optional opening greetings.
       This is the same function as the pull-down button on the salutation field.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Clear</span></dt><dd>
       This will reset all fields back to their default (typically blank)
       vallues.
      </dd></dl></div></div></div></body></html>
