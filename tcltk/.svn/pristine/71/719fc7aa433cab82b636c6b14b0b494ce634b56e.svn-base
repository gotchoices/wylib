} 4.0 text {      This part has a variable dimension L and a variable cable diameter.  The 
} 5.0 text {      L dimension is measured from the ceiling or upper support down to the 
} 6.0 text {      baffle strips which are on a 30 to 45 degree angle.  The lengths will 
} 7.0 text {      vary depending on the angle of the baffle strips.  The installer must

} 9.0 text {
} 10.0 text {      In addition, the cable diameter can vary.  The spreadsheet defaults to 
} 11.0 text {      3/16" cable.  However, for installation of 10ga baffles, 1/8" cable is 
} 12.0 text {      much easier to use.  Use the smaller cable where possible.
} 13.0 text {
} 14.0 text {      Furthermore, the upper end of the cable has two termination options - a
} 15.0 text {      Loop option or a Bracket option.  The Loop option is used if the cable is
} 16.0 text {      to be tied to existing overhead truss work.  The loop should be large 
} 17.0 text {      enough to just pass over 1/4x2 angle iron (you can test using the cable 
} 18.0 text {      bracket).  If the installer requests a different loop size, accomodate 
} 19.0 text {      him.
} 20.0 text {
} 21.0 text {      For installations where the ceiling is concrete, use the Bracket option.
} 22.0 text {      For this option, pass the cable through the 3/8" hole leaving the 1/2" 
} 23.0 text {      hole to anchor into the ceiling.  In this case, make the cable loop as 
} 24.0 text {      small as possible.
} 25.0 text {
} 26.0 text {      Cut the cables so that when assembled, the overall ``L'' dimension equals
} 27.0 text {      the specification of the installer.  Note that you must always make an
} 28.0 text {      allowance for the differing loop size between the two termination options.
} 29.0 text {      See figure \ref{fig:modbaf.hangkit} and note the differences in cable
} 30.0 text {      length.  You must also add another 1" to be clamped in the clamp bolt.  
} 31.0 text {      Before  cutting, make sure you have added enough for the loop and extra

} 34.0 text {      Do this section regardless of the termination option being used.  Place a 
} 35.0 text {      1/2" flat washer over the drilled bolt.  Pass the end of the cable 
} 36.0 text {      through the hole in the drilled bolt.  Push the bolt through the cable 
} 37.0 text {      bracket as shown in figure \ref{fig:modbaf.hangkit}.  Place a split 
} 38.0 text {      washer over the bolt and then a nut.  Slide the drilled bolt up the cable 
} 39.0 text {      about 1' from the lower end.  Tighten the bolt just tight enough so the 
} 40.0 text {      bracket won't slide off.
