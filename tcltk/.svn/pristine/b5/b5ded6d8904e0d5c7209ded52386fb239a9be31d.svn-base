  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
   The table Embedded Text Widget (ETW) allows you to produce rows and
   columns of tabular data in a Wylib document.
   This type of ETW may be used in several different types of documents
   such as letters and product documentation.
  </para><para>
   Tables can be formatted in a way similar to a figure, where a caption
   is shown under the table, and the 
   <ulink url="etwref.html">REF (reference) widget.</ulink>
   can be used to create a numerical reference to the table.
  </para><para>
   Like all ETW's, there is a main menu in the upper left part of the widget
   where all the widget's functionality can be accessed.
   Just under the menu button are two shortcut buttons (Column and Row)
   to allow faster access to two common functions also found in the menu.
  </para><para>
   Tabular data can be imported and/or exported from CSV files such as
   might be created from a spreadsheet program.

  <title>Standard Fields</title>

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Tag:</term>
      <listitem>
       When the table is created, you will be asked to provide a tag name.
       This is a short name consisting of alpha characters which may be
       used to refer to this table.
       So each table within a document should have a unique tag name.
       Once the table has been created, the tag can not be changed.
       If you need to change it, export the data to a file, create a new
       table with the desired tag name, and import the data into the new table.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Style:</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This controls how the table will be formatted.
        The "Plain" method will indent the table with the value provided
        in the Indent field.
        There will be no caption or centering of the table.
       </para><para>
        The "Figure" method will center the table and will provide a caption
        consiting of the Title you provide.
        This is the only method that will allow you to refer to the table
        using the 
        <ulink url="etwref.html">REF (reference) widget.</ulink>
        The Indent value will be ignored.
       </para><para>
        The "Centered" method will center the table but will not provide a caption.
        No references may be used, and the Indent value will be ignored.
        consiting of the Title you provide.
       </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Indent:</term>
      <listitem>
       When the Style is set to "Plain," this value will determine how
       far the table will be indented from the left side of the page.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Title:</term>
      <listitem>
       The text you enter here will be shown as a caption for the table
       if the Style is set to "Figure."
       Otherwise, the title is not used when rendering the document.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>(Cells)</term>
      <listitem>
       There is one cell at the intersection of each row and column.
       Rows and columns may be added or deleted as described below.
       Once you have the desired number of cells, you can type any text
       value into each of the cells.
      </listitem>

  <title>Menu Options</title>
   The widget menu contains a number of functions to allow you to control
   the size and attributes of the table.
   The menu functions are as follows:

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Add Columns</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This will increase the number of columns in the table.
        The program will ask you how many columns you wish to add.
        The added columns will be added at the right side of the table.
       </para><para>
        Note that there is a menu at the top of each column that will allow
        you to add columns into the center of the table and/or delete
        columns from the center of the table.
       </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Add Rows</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This will increase the number of rows in the table.

        The added rows will be added at the bottom of the table.
       </para><para>
        Note that there is a menu on the left side of each row that will allow
        you to add rows into the center of the table and/or delete
        rows from the center of the table.
       </para>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Remove Columns</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This will decrease the number of columns in the table.
        The program will ask you how many columns you wish to remove.
        The columns will be removed from the right side of the table.
       </para><para>
        Note that there is a menu at the top of each column that will allow
        you to add columns into the center of the table and/or delete
        columns from the center of the table.
       </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Remove Rows</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        This will decrease the number of rows in the table.
        The program will ask you how many rows you wish to remove.
        The rows will be removed from the bottom of the table.
       </para><para>
        Note that there is a menu on the left side of each row that will allow
        you to add rows into the center of the table and/or delete
        rows from the center of the table.
       </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Clear Table</term>
      <listitem>
       This will remove all the data from the cells in the table and will
       reset the header fields to their default values.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Import</term>
      <listitem>
       This will allow you to load the table cells with data from a CSV
       from the disk.
       A CSV file can be created (exported) from most spreadsheet programs.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Export</term>
      <listitem>
       This will allow you to create a CSV file on the disk which contains
       the data from the cells of the table.
       The data can then be viewed and/or edited in most common spreadsheet programs.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Set Delimiter</term>
      <listitem>
       CSV files consist of rows of data wherein each row is separated by a delimiter character.
       In a standard CSV file, the delimiter is normally a comma (,).
       It is possible to specify a different delimiter character using this menu function.
      </listitem>

  <title>Row and Column Menu Options</title>
   Each row and column has a special menu that will act upon that specific
   row or column.
   Typically these menu items are used for adding or deleting rows or
   columns from within the center of the table.
   The menu functions are as follows:

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Bump 1</term>
      <listitem>
        This will insert one column (or row) before the column (or row) from whose menu the command is executed.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Bump n</term>
      <listitem>
        This will insert multiple columns (or rows) before the column (or row) from whose menu the command is executed.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Delete 1</term>
      <listitem>
        This will remove the column (or row) from whose menu the command is executed.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Delete n</term>
      <listitem>
        This will remove multiple columns (or rows) starting with the column (or row) from whose menu the command is executed.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Display Width</term>
      <listitem>
       This will adjust how wide the column is as it is displayed on the screen.
       It has no effect on the way the document is ultimately formatted (printed).
       During formatting, all columns are adjusted for a "best fit" to the actual data in the column.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   </variablelist>
