TODO:

- Move site specific stuff out from this file so it is just wylib related

X- Shared calendar program
X-   add employees to calendar events
-   add conim contacts to calendar events           
-   add personal contacts to calendar events        
-   add vendor contacts to calendar events

- finish TODO's in dbp
- re-write ddis.tcl (clean it up)

- deploy emplim / payroll
X-   temporary deploy of emplim (so we can use priv window)
X-   use materialized path for empl hierarchy
X-   better data integrity triggers 
X-   port wholdings to wylib
X-   port payroll.tcl to wylib
X-   delta port file for payroll tables (pay_req, empl_whold)
-   use cdoc.tcl in emplim
-   payroll views should show only my employees (unless I have admin priv)

- New conim
-   integrate CS ticket system
-   keep cont_doc_data files in filesystem?
-   better support for bulk mail in cont_doc
-   generic cont_doc template for other pims

- New ordtool
-   integrate RMA, Requisition tools

- New ledit
-   use wylib, etext
-   use latest lout
-   split into generic/site-specific specific parts
-   etw's are part of wylib
-   add support for form letters (bulk-mail)

- New noedit

- deploy WALT key on ATI platform
-   key bindings support WALT key
-   control key still does traditional bindings

- Wylib fixes:
- wyattize report.tcl
- can we get rid of tsearch.tcl now?

WHAT ARE THESE:
- make help menu do something reasonable
- retain history for search/replace widget (implement ::prefs)
- test edwin
- should Esc bind to spf in dbe's?
- paste undo buffer working? (Ctrl-B)
- implement right-click context menus across widgets?
- save, load, print in text windows?

- implement in listbox?:
  - kill function
  - spell function

- redo date spinners (-dest switch, -def switch, should spentry be a dew?)

- redo phonemap?
- get rid of all references to cnf in library (only in priv.tcl now)

MAYBE LATER:
- module for macros (make savable macros, autoexec macro)

- add bind method to all widgets?
  (because with standard bind, you can't hide the guts of how the widget is implemented i.e. stext)

- how do dew and cdew use each other?
X  - how can we use grid to line up a bunch of dews (so their titles align)
  - should cdew consist of multiple dews?
  - can a dew call a cdew? (date::dia)
