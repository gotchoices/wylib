  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
   This widget is used to set operating the default characteristics (preferences) of a Wylib application.
   There are settings you can change that apply only to that application.
   These settings are typically found in the first tab of the preferences window.
   For example, in a contact manager, there might be a setting for the state you want to search for contacts each time the program starts.
   For more information on the specific settings for your application, see the help manual for the specific application.
   Also, try waving the cursor over specific settings in the preferences window.
   Read the pop-up help messages to see more about what each setting does.
  </para><para>
   There are also preferences (such as font sizes and so forth) which may apply only to the current application or which may be set to apply to all Wylib applications.
   These are called Global Settings.
   There are several more tabs for setting Global Preferences which will be used in a variety of different situations (which application is being used, what screen size is being used, etc.)

  <title>Enabling Settings</title>
  <para>
   Note that each setting in the dialog has a field where you can fill out a value, or a checkbox to enable a particular feature.
   In addition, there is a checkbox to the right of the feature.
  </para><para>
   Even though you may fill out a value for a feature, that feature is still not going to take effect until you check the Enable button to the right of the feature.
   Make sure you do both if you want the feature to have an effect.
  </para>

  <title>Global Settings</title>
  <para>
   Global settings can be set in at least 3 different screens.
   The first screen is typically the one that applies to the application you are running
   when you set the preferences.
   When you set font sizes and so forth in this screen, the changes will only take effect when you are running that specific module.
  </para><para>
   The next tab will typically be for a certain screen size.  
   This is explained in the next section.
  </para><para>
   The final tab (All Apps) is used for setting fonts and colors for all Wylib applications
   running on any size screen.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Running on a Particular Screen Size</title>
  <para>
   Each time the Wylib application starts, it checks to see the size (in pixels) of screen you are using.
   If there are specific preferences settings saved for that screen size, they will be enabled.
   If not, a new preferences tab will be created for that screen size, just in case you want to change settings for that screen size.
   So you may see several preferences tabs for different screen sizes you have used before.
  </para><para>
   Perhaps the most important use of these settings is when you log in remotely using VNC or some other method.
   Often your screen at your desk is larger than what you can support from your laptop or other remote access.
   So, you can set smaller fonts for the smaller screen size so you can display more information on your smaller screen.
  </para>

  <title>Running in a Custom Profile</title>
  <para>
   Each application typically has a name (like "emplim," "vendim," etc.) which is specified by your local operating environment.
   When preferences are saved for one of the first two tabs 
   (Application Settings Application Only, and Global Settings Application Only)
   they are typically associated with the name of the application.
   This way, each time the application starts, it can find the correct settings
   specified just for that application.
  </para><para>
   It is possible to instruct a wylib application to use a non-standard name for one running instance of the program.
   For example, if you are running a contact manager called "conim," it is possible to tell
   the application to consider itself the application "conim-small."
   Then, when you run the program, you can save preferences and they will only take effect
   in other future instances of the program similarly instructed to run as "conim-small."
  </para><para>
   To do this, you would have to type the following in a shell window:
  </para><para>
       WYLIB_APPNAME="conim-small" conim
  </para><para>
   Note that this can not easily be done when launching the program from a start menu or other standard means.
   Typically, you will need to type the command each time, or create a shell script, a launch button or some other shortcut to do it for you.
