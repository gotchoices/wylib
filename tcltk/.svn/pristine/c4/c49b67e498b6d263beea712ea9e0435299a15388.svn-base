   The attachment Embedded Text Widget (ETW) allows you to attach a
   reference document to a letter.
   This is helpful when you want to refer to some other document in your
   correspondence and you want that document to be transmitted with the
   letter to the recipient, and also filed in the system with your
   letter.
  </p><p>
   Like all ETW's, there is a main menu in the upper left part of the widget
   where all the widget's functionality can be accessed.
  </p><p>
   It should not matter where in your letter the attachments are actually placed.
   However, it is a matter of good form to place them together at (or near) the end of the letter.
  </p><p>
   Typically an attachment is a file on the disk which has a standard content
   type (so the system knows how to handle it) like PS, PDF, DOC, GIF, JPG, etc.
   Depending on your local configuration, it may also be possible to attach
   other types of documents (like customer orders).

       This field can not be edited directly.
       Instead, it gets filled out at the time the attachment is first created.
       The field shows the path name of the disk file you have used for the attachment.
       If you want to change the attachment, the pull-down button will open a file selector to allow you to do so.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Type:</span></dt><dd>
       This field normally has the value "file."
       But if the local configuration allows the attachment of other types of
       documents, this field may contain some other value (like "order").
       This field is not directly editable.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Descr:</span></dt><dd>
       This field contains a description of the attachment.
       What you enter in this field will show up on the attachment line for
       this document at the bottom of your letter.
       It will also be used when creating email attachments.

   The widget menu contains a number of functions to allow you to control
   the attachment.
   The menu functions are as follows:

   <div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">View Document</span></dt><dd>
       This will allow you to see the document in a viewer applicable to
       the document's particular content type.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Print Document</span></dt><dd>
       This will attempt to translate the document to the Postscript format
       and will then send it to the standard print handler.
      </dd><dt><span class="term">Save To File</span></dt><dd>
       This will allow you to export the document back to a disk file.
       This may be helpful, for example, if you want to re-edit the document.
      </dd></dl></div></div></div></body></html>
