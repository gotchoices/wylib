  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
   The reference Embedded Text Widget (ETW) allows you to reference a table
   or figure numerically without actually knowing the number of the table
   or figure.
   For example, imagine you insert a figure into your document, and somewhere
   else in your document you have a sentence such as 
   "please refer to figure 1."
  </para><para>
   Then, later on you decide to insert another figure before the first one.
   Now what was figure 1 has become figure 2.
   But it would be nice if the sentence referring to it would automatically
   change to say:
   "please refer to figure 2."
  </para><para>
   In order to allow this, Wylib refers to figures and tables by a tag name
   rather than a number.
   Each time you create a figure or a table, you have to specify a tag name
   to uniquely identify the figure or table.
   Then, in place of the "2" in the referring sentence, you would insert
   the reference ETW, and have it point to the tag name of the table or
   figure you want to refer to.
  </para><para>
   Then, when the document is formatted, the appropriate number will be
   inserted for you.

   Like all ETW's, there is a main menu in the upper left part of the widget
   where all the widget's functionality can be accessed.

  <title>Standard Fields</title>

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>(tag name)</term>
      <listitem>
       The (only) entry is where you specify the tag name of the figure or
       table you want to refer to.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   </variablelist>

  <title>Menu Options</title>
   The widget menu contains a number of functions to allow you to control
   the address information.
   The menu functions are as follows:

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Locate Reference</term>
      <listitem>
       This will show you where the figure or table is that is pointed
       to by this reference.
       It will do so by accentuating the border of the figure or table
       momentarily so it will be easier to see.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   </variablelist>
