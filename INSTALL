Installation Instructions

If you are only using wylib javascript libraries, you should be fine with a 
standard npm installation:

  npm install wylib

In many cases, this will be done for you if wylib is required by some other
package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to use the legacy TCL library, you will need to make it possible
for tcl to find the library.  The usual way is to put wylib somewhere in the
search path used at load time ($auto_load), or to set the environment variable
TCLLIBPATH to include the directory that contains the wylib root directory.

There is a utility called wylib-info included in the distribution that should
help you do this.  If you installed wylib globally, as in:

  npm install -g wylib

then wylib should be in some public area such as /usr/lib/node_modules/wylib
and there should be a link to the executable wylib-info someplace like /bin,
/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.  Wylib will print out its parent directory, the
library name, and its version string.  So you should be able to put something
like the following in your .bash_profile or some other initialization file:

if command -v wylib-info >/dev/null; then
  read libdir libname version <<<$(wylib-info)
  export TCLLIBPATH="$libdir $TCLLIBPATH"
fi

If you intend to connect to postgresql using legacy TCL libraries, you will
also have to install support for that with something like (on fedora):

  dnf install postgresql-tcl
